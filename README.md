# Realtime AI Voice Bot

A custom-built **Realtime AI Voice Bot** that converts your speech to text (STT), generates intelligent responses using a Large Language Model (LLM), and replies back using Text-to-Speech (TTS) — all in real-time!

> **Note:** This project is developed from scratch without copying code from any open-source GitHub repositories.

---

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Converts live speech input into text using modern speech recognition APIs.
- **Large Language Model (LLM):** Processes the text input to generate context-aware, intelligent responses.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts the LLM-generated text responses back into natural-sounding speech.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Enables seamless, hands-free conversation.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Client:** JavaScript / TypeScript (Web Audio API, Web Speech API)
- **Server:** Python (Flask / FastAPI) or Node.js (Express) — handles AI requests and response generation
- **AI Model:** Custom integration with OpenAI GPT API or locally hosted LLM for generating responses
- **Speech Recognition:** Browser’s Web Speech API or third-party STT APIs
- **Text-to-Speech:** Browser’s SpeechSynthesis API or third-party TTS services

## Architecture Overview

1. **Client Side:**
   - Captures live audio from the user microphone.
   - Converts speech to text (STT).
   - Sends transcribed text to the server.

2. **Server Side:**
   - Receives the text input.
   - Passes the input to the LLM API or model to generate a response.
   - Sends the response text back to the client.

3. **Client Side:**
   - Converts the response text to speech (TTS).
   - Plays the audio reply for the user.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IkramAlgo/Realtime-AI-Voice-Bot.git
cd Realtime-AI-Voice-Bot
````

---

### 2. Server Setup

* Navigate to the server directory (if separate):

```bash
cd server
```

* Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or if Node.js:
npm install
```

* Create `.env` file and add your API keys (OpenAI, STT/TTS services) if required.

* Run the server:

```bash
python app.py
# or
npm start
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (adjust if needed).

### 3. Client Setup

* Navigate to the client directory (if separate):

```bash
cd client
```

* Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

* Run the client:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

* Click the “Start” button or similar to begin voice capture.
* Speak clearly into your microphone.
* The bot will transcribe your speech, process your input with AI, and respond using synthesized voice.
* Talk naturally and get real-time conversational feedback.

---

## Development Notes

* This project is built from the ground up with original code.
* The AI response uses either OpenAI’s GPT or a local LLM based on your setup.
* You can swap STT or TTS services with your preferred providers by updating client/server config.
* TypeScript is used on the client for type safety and better maintainability.

## Known Issues

* Currently facing some **server response delays** which affect the real-time experience.
* Actively working on improving server speed and stability.
* Any suggestions or contributions are welcome and highly appreciated!
